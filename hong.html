<h2> About Me</h2>
<p> Hi there! I am a recent college graduate with a background in UX design. 
    In 2021, it is valuable that designers should learn to code. 
    This force drives me to upgrade my skillset inorder to become a software developer as well! 
</p>

    I was born in Taishan, China, a small county-level city that was known as the "First Home of Overseas Chinese". 
    I came to New York when I was around 7 years old. Since then, Brooklyn had always been my home.
    Here in Brooklyn, I am grateful to meet different people from different parts of the world!

</p>
<P> Other than coding, my other hobbies are drawing and exploring the city. Check out my hobbist instagram account at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silentartworks/"> silentartworks</a> and my black and white aesthetic blog at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/9wavetail/">9wavetail</a> !</P>
